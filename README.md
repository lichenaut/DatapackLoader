# DatapackLoader

Note: this codebase has moved to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/lichenaut/DatapackLoader

DatapackLoader automatically adds datapacks to your Minecraft server! This plugin can be used to install datapacks and quicken datapack development. DatapackLoader supports Folia, but does not make Folia-incompatible datapacks compatible with Folia.
